Netflix Data Analysis Project:

In a comprehensive data analysis project, I leveraged Python and its libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, to conduct a thorough exploration and visualization of the Netflix dataset. Using the CSV dataset provided by Netflix, I applied a range of data analysis techniques to gain valuable insights.

Utilizing Pandas, I performed data manipulation and cleaning tasks, ensuring data integrity and accuracy throughout the project. With NumPy, I conducted statistical analysis, extracting key metrics and identifying trends within the dataset. This allowed for a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and characteristics of the Netflix data.

To enhance the visual representation of the findings, I employed Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visually compelling data visualizations, including bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps. These visualizations effectively communicated the analysis results, making complex data more accessible and engaging.

Throughout the project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis and data visualization skills, showcasing the ability to handle and analyze large datasets, derive meaningful insights, and effectively communicate the findings through clear and impactful visualizations. This project serves as a testament to my strong analytical capabilities and proficiency in Python libraries for data analysis.
